To all which 1 answer, that srom hence it is manifest, that
the sense os als animate creaturea, aud the opinion of mankind
both bad and good, ie with the author, and l drasl always

But 2dly, Whereas it is pretended that the best christiane are

1 ansiver, That the nature of things ie and ought to besueh,
that they operate more or· lesa according to their distance. Thus
the sun at the distance of s'o many misce scema only a l'oot
broad, and every thing iu like manner, by its remotenes's,
lessens both irs· apparent magnitude and efficacy. Now sance the
pleasiues of srearen are at a great distance from us, and cau
only be apprehende-d hy saith and hope, 'ris no wonder that
they are overhalauced by the pleasures of this life, which are
present and immediately affest our senses. , ·

lf any ask wlt God made us so that things at a distance are
'sess affesiing. fanswer, if causes did operate equally at all
dissurcce it would eonfouud the order of the world, and bring
insirrite inconveniencies ou the creaturea. ls the sun were aa

but all must vanish into sinoak. ln the same mannetis things

passions, appetitio, [de. we corrld not pass orte day with ease
and larissaeum. God therefore has well and wisel provided
that we should not lose the present good either through dread of
suturity, or· mernory of what is pasf3 but that the bepehts of
this irrorral life, though small in comparison, should often affest
us more than nurch greater orrea to come. The good os the
whole syrium required that we should stay out appointed time in
this world, aas it not therefore gracioussy ordained thatthit
world should appear very good and desirable to us?

But edly, 's'hough good christiana believe that heaven is much
better than this present state, yet the best areconscious to them·
selvcs that they arc srnners, and have ofrenoffended a just God,
and cousequently have some doubt and terror outhem when they
are summoned to ap ear before his tribunal.
