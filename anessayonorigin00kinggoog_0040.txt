means ¹of happiness, is different from the approbationi
ruf any other means; because it imp'ies an approbation
also of an endeavour to promote the happiness¹ of that ,
agent, in ortler to excite him and others to the same
concern for my happiness for the future.

And because what we approveos we also desne(as has
been ‘ssrewn above) hence also we destre the happin‘ess of
any agentthat has done us good. And therefore love
othmari, when placed on a rational 0ὺῇεᾶ, has this
difference from the lor'e and. hatrecl os other thiug'a,
that it implies adefire of, and consequentlv a pleafute
in the happiness-of the objest beloved; or if hated, the
:colstlraerl'oundation of th'a approbation aud love (which,
aa we have seen, conlifls in his voluntary contributing

-like creatores, whose happiness is dependent on each
other's behaviour) to our approbation and love: de-

&a does not follow, or it presumed not to follow it,
such a person iv rechoncd unworthy of any favour, be·

being obliged by favour&

The mistake which forne have run into, viz. that me·
rit is inconsistent with aeting upon private happiness, as
an ultimate end, seems-tohave arisen frorn hence, viz.
that they havenot carefully enough distinguished bc·
