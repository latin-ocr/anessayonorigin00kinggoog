Yet we deny the consequence. He is neither .
to be esteemed envious' nor imputent, because

he does not work contradidions: But it isa
contradidion that all evils should be removed,
without removing the whole universe, which
would be the greatest os all evils. For some
kind os evils adhere (as we have osten declared)

to the very natures os things, and cannot be
removed while any created nature continues.
For when a circle is once made, all the lines .
drawn srom the centre to the circumferente
must necessarily be equal; neither is God im·· ·
potent, because he cannot make them unequal
while it continues to be acircle: in like man-
ner, when he has made a creature, he must
necessarily tolerate the evil of imperfestion in

it, which is as essential to itas an equalityos
the radii is to the circle. When therefore'
matter, motion and free-will, ate constituted, ·
he must necessarily permit corruption os things,
and the abuse os liberty, or something worse.
For these cannot be separated (as was lhewn)
without a contradidion. God therefore is no
more imputent because he cannot remove these
evils stom things while the things themselves
remain, than because he cannot separate ah
equality of the radii stom a circle. The con· .
sequence, then is salse, which charges God with

lm otenee because he cannot remove evils.

lx. Neither is that affertion less salse which Gor al·
attributes it to envy that he will not. For he mmm
that always wills the best, and the least os many nan of
evils, is absolutely good, aud the farthestsrom “³¹⁵2 ²¹¹4

with respe& to God. Jsa person had bis choice oue.
either to abolilh or not to abolish evil, he
would be malicious is he did not abolilh it.

But when the choice is between this and a
greater evil, he that choosee the less is far from
