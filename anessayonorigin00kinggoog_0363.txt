But adly, We must distinguissr between the choiee and the
meant os obtaining it. When once the choiee it made, the most
uls ond effetlual wa sos obtaining‘ the thing chosen please trs
he. Arnan rs to ghtabattle, lits choree rs toeonqtterylre
thinks os means ιο execute it. Several ways occur, and he pitche'e
upon one, which leasee and ie chosen, not sor itself‚ but ar sirh-
serrient to hit reste of victory. An angel appears and diretta
him to another: noneean doubt but thir will cause extraordinary
joy in him, because it bringa him ιο obtain hir choice by the mort

certain and infallible meant. Now thie ia so sar from roring
that clinice ir not the thing that gives goodness to objetlr, that

it direslly prover the contrary. For here the only thing that '

makes hirn reje& what hit reason proposed to him aethe best
meana to obtain his ehoiee, is because he hus discovered abet-
tee. On the other hand, if a general out os treachery should dc·
sign to lose a battle, and it happened in tlte hurty that he should
he soreetl to do something that gained it, ltc would not please
himself in the aetion. llere's a eitlory that is good to one, and
ill ιο another, aud the differente liet plainly in the one'e choos-
in and tlte other'rrejeslin it.

lsut 2dly, 'tit objectet, that a Janseaiyl or Cas-vinis who gives
a· arms, aar a nnana nat oar inspira inm rodo so, n ber.
ter pleased with imself than a Stoic, who attrahutes ιο hirnsels
all the gloryos a charitable aetion. Wcll, what then? There-
fore things do not please us because we chonse them. No such
matter. A true Christian, call hirn Jarrsenifl, or what you will,
ehoot'et to prefer tlte glory ot' God to hie own, and therefore he
ir better pleased to think the glory os what he doen belongs to
God, than to himself, as tltis ie inore agreenble to hia ehoiee.

In short, all tlte instanter l have seen areos the same noture3
and is there werea thousand os thern they all rereire tlte struae
answer, they are nothinp to the purpose, and prove no more thart
that ιοοιὲὶοιι best please with the moll efl‘ettuat meana to obtain
their ele iona.

But yrlly, lt ie alledged, that if tlte happiness of man confisle
in hirehoice, God ought ιο hare lest ltitn fairly to that choree,
so tltat neither the other facultiee os hit soul nor qualities osob·
jfec‘lsd, sttoultl have any¹ power over him to restrain tlte use of hia

ree orn.

lsl undetssaud'thia right, the meaning os it ir, that God should
not hare given man any particular appetitu detennined ιο their
