Seu. 5.- Sub. 3. Of Moral 'Eois 345.

We have said that God made the world, in or-' ΤΦ ⁰f
der to have something wherein to exercise his ,2222
attributes externally: but srnce he has several ‘¹¹0 8⁰·
attributes, he cannot exercise them all in every {ffss‘ffiss‘
thing alike. His power therefore exerts itsels riter-elon
chiefly in ope thing, and his wisdom and good· ¹⁸ ¹¹¹⁰ Ρπμ
ness in another. He exercised his power insimili}
creating the world, and putting it into motion; divvs
his goodness and wisdom in the order and agree· affl·
ment os things: but the divine wisdom seems oon ae·
to have set apart the government os free agents lgm·
as its peculias province. Herein it sully exer-

ciseth itsels,‹-‘and ads up to its infinity; sor is

’ it were finiteit would not be equal to so great

a tassr. It does not seem a very extraordinary

thing for God to be able to govern and abso-

lutely dire& suchw beings as are merely passive,

and deprived os all motion os their own, where-

by they might make a-ny refistance. For those
things obey easily which do not movebut when

they are moved. Neither is there need os in-

finite wisdonr to govern them3 sor infinite
power, with a moderate uscos wisdom, would

have been sufficient. That there might be a
subjest therefore whereon the infinite wistlom

of God should display itsels, he created free
agents; which, being as it were put out os his
power and lest to themselves, might ast in a
manner independent os his will. 'Tis evident

to any person how much more difficolt it is, .
and how much greater exercise os wisdom it
requires to dire& a multitude os these to acer-

tain end, and make them conspire to the com·

mon good, than to order brute beasts, and such

as have no power os themselves, in what man·

uer you lease. To thern that consider the vast
multitude os sree agents, which is almost in-
finite, and their independence (stnce every one

is, at· least in many cases, absolute master¹htys
