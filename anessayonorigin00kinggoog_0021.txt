tire, tho' perhaps less entertaining to some premature
adventurers, who were discouraged at their first setting ·
out,1by a few uncouth things about the beginning of
our author’s book, which might perhaps as well have ·
been omitted, could that have been done, without too
much mangling or desacing os his work 3-however,

such delicate readers as will take offence at what they
term too heavy an Exordium, may probably lind their

disgust relieved, by beginning either at the third fection
os the second Chapter: or at Chapter the third; which
methodis here accordingly recommended to them. ·

To proceed. 1 had. now the satissaslion os seeing that
those yery principles which had been maintained by
Archb. King, were adopted by Mt. Pope in -his Effay on
Mam this 1 used to recolleel, and sometimes relate, .
with pleasute, conceiving that such an account did no
ι less honour to the Poet, than to our Philosopher3 but
was soon made to understand that any thing os that kind
was taken highly amisa, by one who had once held the
Dodlrine os that same Effiry to be rank Atheism, but as-
terwatd turned a warm advocate sor it, and thought
proper to deny the account above-mentioned, with¹
heavy menaces against those who presumed to insinuate
that Pope borrowed any thing from any man whatso-
ever. The fast, notwithstanding such denial‚ might
have been stristly verified by an unexceptionable testi·'
,mony, viz. that os the late Lord Bathurst, who saw the
very same system os the τ. 9 iiiiii (taken from the Arch- ⁸
· bilhop) in Lord Bolingbsoke's own hand, lying before
Mr. Pope while he was composing his Effay.

This point may also be cleared effedually, when ever*
any reader shall think it worth his while to compare

the two pieces together ς and observo how exadly they
tally with each orben—But enough os these triding
