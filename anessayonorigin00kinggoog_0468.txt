“ To have esctped hell, and to find ourselvet in the un·
⁴⁴ changeable possession os salvation by the free mercy and
⁴⁸ goodnese of God, and hythe death of nis own Son, are
“ thoughts which must create a new heaven at it were to
“ heaven itself3 l mean they will enlar e our soult nothe
“ utmoll capacity os our nutrires, end ill and ncluate them
’“ with such divine ardore os lete, ae is we had been kept
“ necessarily srom all lin, seem impothble te have been raised
“ in ue .”

This elren we may, with merente, presunt to havebeeo the
principa! delign of God in permitting all mankind to bring
themselves into such a dangeroue estate, and some os them to
sussn· under lli and perhaps the same reason will lrold sor lrit
permitting the sall ts angeli.- For 1 think it plainl appured
l'rom note η. that the good, or rather aeduesr, oi dre eret·
ture, is properly the ultimate end of ati the dispensatione ul
God3 and not hie own glny, any sarther than it it the meant
to it. His glory seems to be displayed no otherwise than at it it
subservierit and necessary to this end3 and necessary& 5 since
goodnesr ie os our own making, and musi require resurge,
example, trial, &a (see note 66.) as motivet end meautto
further ns in the gradual formanon osa suitable temperanti
proper habits here, thc enlargement and improvement os which
iiim consilitute our· heaven hereafter, as Scottand Ryrner have

ewn at argo.

Virtue therefore or moral good, cannot (as nayre imagines)
he insused into us miraculously3 neither could b'od, according
to the order cffour ideas, have acquainted us with so much ol
his adorable nature, his hurty, long-suffering, geodaeess nd
trutlr (as lte himself describes it) [h] norcons uentlyhave
brought us to so great a resemblance os ir. by any <iliter method.
The sole idea ol n Being infinitely perfeci, as Bayse obielltffl
would not do the bufinese; nor tf tt were received and attended
to, could it be os sufficient force to intluence the mindt ol men,
and regulare their praefice, as is· evident from daily experiente.
The present scheme os providence was therefore necess'ary,io
order to produce in the generality os men, the greatest degree ol

gondri? in this life, which lethe ground nnd foundation ol

their oppinefs in the next. Even there also the memory ol their
former trialt (as was hinted above) the consciouliress of their
own happy choiee‚ when others did, and they had the lame
power and the same temptations to have done otherwise 2-the
joyful reflellion on their pull dangers and present safet53-and
the natural consequence os all this, love end gratitude, and
glory to God in tlte highest, and mutual congratulatione ol
each other-These and the like comtemplatione will (as Jeulr't
says) createa new heaven in heaven itsels.
