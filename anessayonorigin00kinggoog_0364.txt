consequence in the argument, it rather proves the contrary. re

' we must take notice that good and evil are respebiive things, end
have relation to some appetite. Now we have several ayZeu'tes
deterrnined to their obitas, arrd the things agreenble and clv gret·
able to them are good or bad antecedently to choice. But there
are other things, that hnve no agreeableness or inconveniency to

even death itsels= and therefore it is not⁹nteant of thern, oros
thie sort of evil, when we say we cannot choose evil. But itit
absolutely impossible that we should choose what is contmy to
clinice, and so evil in that sense3 fortheri we ssrould choose it,
and not choosc it at the sante cirne.

But 5thly‚ 'Tis further objesled, thet those who believe thtt
they are only free from construint‚ those that think their will is
determiuerl by the understanding‚ end those who are os opinion
tltnt they possess indifference os will, are all equally content
with themselves, so they choose conveniently; that is, so they
enioy their choico, or attain sonte great good whether they sore·
saw it or no.

I answer, this mnybe true, but nothing to the purpos23 bute
it is manifest nll os them snake a choice, and provided they ob·
tnin wltntthey have chosen, they are sofar satisbed5 which only
proves that our choicc, whether we believe it to be necelhtated er
voluntory, isos so great force as to maltethe thing choscn agret-
