Nay that dire lust of rule which bewitcher .
mortal minds, and transports them beyond
themselves ; which cannot be satisfied unless the
whole world be subdued, and even not then;
this neither receives its origin hor approbation
from nature or any innate appetito

But the soree of elestion is never. mo're ap- ⁸
parent than in some men's insatiable avarice,

into wickedness.
