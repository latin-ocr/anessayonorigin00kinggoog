Ancon,

Tire isauri os fact contained in this argument, in my
opinion, is not to be 'contested3 and therefore it reniains
esther that we make the niatter of fact consistent with
what we have before laid down, or give up the cause. ’
“ Now, in order to shew this consistency, l beg l'eave³ to -
obferre, that an in the porsuit os truth we do not always

t'race every proposition whose troili we are exarnining, ιο ’
a first principle or axium, but acquiesce, as soon as we pet·
oeive it deducible sioni sonie known or presumed truth;
so in our conduct we 'do not always travel ιο the ultimate

and rneans qs hapyilness whether real or otherwise, al.

Now every inan, boh in hls pnrsnit aster trutli, and
