God’s influence and affistance in those cases in which
he could want them. »

For 1st. Man might be at a loss how to preserve his
body from decays, to which (as was observed before) it
was naturally subject. And adly, how to direst his ac-
tions. For the first os these God a pointed the trec
of life. Not that any trec by any natur virtue could pre-
serve us immortale but smce God commanded man to eat .
os it as osten as he needed to be restored in his body, he
surely was ready and able to convcy his supernatural as- ,
sistance to him by it, and make it effesiual to the design
sor which itwas appointed. Man’s eating therefore os it

the use of that tree is plain from Chap. iii. ver. aa. And

now lest he put forth his hand, and take also os ebe trec of

life, and eat and livesor ever, therefore the Lord G od sent ,
him forth from the gardan of Edcn. This lhcws, that the
