inonllera os mankind, and rona to every att of wickedoess and

malentes& observed in the second place, that one preat crime,
· sucli aa nitiitlier, thest, or rapine, ia ostener talkedo , more tini·

good, peaceable, generone deeds, whidh malie nh nolle in tlie
world,iior ever coine to public notice, hut are silently passed hy
and overlooked. Which very thing lhewa that the formet are
rnore rare than the latter, otheiw'vse they would not be received
with so much surpriiie, horror, and alstonilhment.

3dly, 'Tio observable that many things are done very inno·

Nero killed a man that waa innocent, bui who knowa whether
he did it out os premeditated inalice? Perhaps some entrulled
with the care os liis person, or a flattering courtier, whom he it
obliged to ilepcnd on, informs of this innocent maii as plotting
a conspiracy against the emperor's life, anil urges dis ateh letlhe
he first surprized i Perhaps the inl'oritier ia impoliti, upon him-
t'elf,aiid thinks it real ι 'tis plain such circumstances very mueli

4ihly, Many things aie done through ignorance of the law,
and liccattl'e those wlio commit thoni do not know that they are
vicioiis; nay they are ol'tcn esleemeil virtues. Thus St. Paris
perleciitetl th'e cliurch; ancl liiinself owna tliat he did it out os
ignoranter, and therefore olitaincil mercy. How many things
ns this kind are done ‹laily liy siicli as profess disserent religione?
’Tis true, theseare fias ς hut sins of ignorante, which easily ob·
