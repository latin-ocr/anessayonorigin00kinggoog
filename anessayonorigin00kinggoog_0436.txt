Os Moral Eoil. Chap. V.

¹ how the contingency os things can be consist-
ent with the divine prescientes Neither is it
proper to meddle with it in this place: For it
would require a whole book. Let it suffice to
give ahint, that the solution os it depends upon
considering the rtrunner by which we apprehend

the things os God. (76.) He that understands

that
nores

“ but all the kind iusluences 01 heaven which supply curvatio,
“ and fill our hearts with sood and gladness, are owing to'that ’
“ good providente which commands nature to yield herinereaser
“ aud those ‹tir'orders of nature which asili& the world with
“ 1111111111, pestilente and earthquakes, are the effeete 01 God'r
‘¹ anger and displeasure, and are ordered by him 101 the pu·
⁴‘ nilhment osa wicked world. We 1111111 all believe this, or
‘¹ consess that we rnoclt God, when we blesshim for a healthsnl
“ air aud fruitsul sensum, or deprecate his anger when we see
⁴‘ visrble tokens 01 his vengeanee in the disorders os nature.
“ For did not God immediately interpose in the overnment 01
“ nature, there would be no reason toheg 1111101011, orde-
“ precare his anger upon these accounts.‘'-And to the sante
purpose he urges. p. 7¹· Tlrat without this belief, that God
takes a particular care of all ltis creatures in the government 11
all events that can happen to tltenr (which belief appears to be
impossible upon the nrechaniras hypothefis) there is no reason ner
pretence sor 111011 01 the particular duties of religious worship,
as is sully proved in the same place. See also C. 9. and lbbst's
Setmnns, 101. ii. p. 21 1.

(76.) He rneans the scheme os analrgy, concerning which see
n. 10. rent. k. We have given our notion 01 the word Pre-
science, ib. R. e. see also Jtrtly‘on on Human Liberty, page 62.
But though we cannot perhaps determine the precite manner 01
God's knowiug‘ tlte free 0111 01 nien, yet we are certain that he
does and 1111111 always know theru: srnee otherwise he would
know many things now which he once did not know, and con.
sequently his uwtnisticnce or infinite knowledge would receive
addition srotn events, (wltich as we hare rnade appear in 111.)
is contrary to the true notion os inlinity. This general argu·
ment drawn from God's infinite or perses? knowledge, seems to
1111 the only oue which can amount to a proof that he moll
always have a compleat and equal knowledge of such aetions as
are in themselves absolutely contingent, as all those evidentlr
are which depend upon the free-will 01 the creature. These
01110111 (as we formerly observtd) rnay properly be called future
with respest to us or other rnen, and the knowledge of thern in
the satne respesl be slilcd fore-knowledge. But with regartl to
the Deity, whose existence and attributes can hare no relation
to time, ι. c. to which nothing can he at a ‹lislance3 l think,
the expression is ahsurd3 and we 1111111 necessarily either adrnit
the sore-mentioned absttrdity os suppoling his knowledge lirnittd‚
