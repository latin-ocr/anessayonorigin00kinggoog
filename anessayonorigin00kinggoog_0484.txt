there are at present, and they would be multi-
plied unneceffarily. Hence it appears how
worthy it is os God to have formed the nature
os things in such a manner, that from the very
constitution of them the intemperate, injurians,
the thies, robber, adulterer, proud, euvinus,
, &a should have something to dread. Is any
one all< why there are not such punishments as
mighteffedlually imprintalivelysense upon our
minds, and thereby totally restrain us frome
wrong choice? 1 answer: A greater evil rnust
not be done on account os a less; but if the
punishments and dread os them were increased
to such a degree as to be sufficient to reveut
all kind os evil, they themselves woul be the
greatest os all evils, and the dread os thern
Α would more deeply alle&² and be a eater
affiislion rothe minds os men, even o those
who would not do amiss, than the evils thern·
selves are, sor the prevention os which these
punishments are proposed by God. lt was

a greater prejudice to our ease¹ and happiness,
than those very evils which are prohibited under

the penalty os them would be, were we sorced
to undergo them.

Posrtive lll. As to the punishments which God ha
