Concerniog the tree of knowledge of good and evil
hete· mentioned, let us observe 1st. that it was a-true lle
teral troo„ and.that we are not to be put· off with a moer
figure. For. it is said, ver. 9..of. the chapton And natos
the groundmde the bord, God to. grew evetydree· thanis
pltffam to the fight‚.and good for food, the trec-of life also
in the mildi-os the goden, and the trec os knowledge of good

trees, thenlo. likewise were the trees-of life amlknowe

of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Now
to understandeating and trees literally. in one part of the
text, and hgutatively in the other, when there· is no inti-

reason. No! it will be plain to any one that conlidens

the defigo of Moses, that heis giving us here the literal

not suit with the notions of some men, to whom the scrip«
ture in the literal sense seems not sufficiendy spiritual,
therefore theyendeavour to alle orizethe history of man’s'
fall, but might with equal realon turn his creation and

that of the world into ahgure. And it is observable,
that the same persons that put a figurative sense on tho
tree of knowledge of ood and evil, and on the manner
of man’s becomingliable to death, as the scriptores deli-¹
ver it ς do the same with the methods God has appointed
. sor our recovery, and deny not only the literal sacraments‚
but likcwise the resurrection of the same body, the powei
of the literal death of Christ and the satissadlion ur7
ehased by it. But we must not separate the literal diona
the mystical sense; as we must not dcny the· baptism of
water, because we acknowledge that of the Spirit‚ not·

the ¹resurreclion of out bodies because we own another of
