observed that* clettions are not changed without
a sense os grief and remorso· For venerer
think of altering thern till we'ate convinced thar
we havc chosen arniss. When therefore we are
dise pointed of the enjoyment of what we hare
choiim we despair, become ‘miserable penitent,
and conscious of an evil choree, and then atlnst
begin to alter our choice; which cennot be done
without an anxious tind' uncasy sen'se'of disap-

been intent upon any electiori, so much the
greater pain it will costus to be forced to change
it. Hence proceeds the difficulty which we feel
in altering elestions; hence many had rather

ersrst in nbsurd clothions than undergo the trou-

not be done without a very 'disagreeable struggle
