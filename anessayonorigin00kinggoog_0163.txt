need we the Demiurgus ol the antient heretics to

NOTES.

(E.) The author har been blamed here for rnaldo any elif·
heulty about such evila aa these ol imperlellion, whic are pro·
ly speaking no evilr at all. It ir triffig, say the objeelors,
nce we sec that the perleelion or any llruhlure or machine con-
lille in thia, that the parta thereos have dlh'erent powera and of-

ficte, and therefore we can easily conceive it ιο be no imperfectiori ’

in the maehine of thc world that ita arte are ol unequal perlec-
tionty for those that scerntu havet lesa celion would not
answer their dehyn, nor frll their placer if ey wire not so un-
cqual. And aa orinaniinatc thtnga they arc neither capable of
good nor eri13 itsrgnillea nothing where they are placed, or ιο
what motione they are subjcdled, fince they cannot complain or be
senfible of their condition. Consequently there ia no such thing
aa the evil ol irnpersrllr'orr, but all te properly natural.

To all which we anlwcr, Firll, The world and every part ol* it
