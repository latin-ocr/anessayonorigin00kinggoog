Of Morus Eois. · chaph&

it might be possible indeed that the will should
no more admit of evil than rlre sight does os sa-
vours: b'ut moral good and evil are very sre-
quently not absolute thingS, but merely relative:
forthere is alrnost no astion which proceeds from
choice,5but what may be good or evil upon a
, change of circumstances *. Even natural evils
themselves are sometimes good and eligible.
Free-will then must needs be indifferent to all
external objesls, and those thirigs which arenow
⁴ agreeable, beeorue shortly disagreeable, accord·
ing to the infinite variety of circumstances and
the exigence os affairs. The will therefore can·
uot be deterrnined to good by objeds. Nay‚
to confess the truth‚.we generally do not choose
objesls because theyare good, but they become
good because sve choose thern. The goodneh
of thern therefore is sor the most part determin-
cd by ‘the elsec‘liom and not that by the goodnes .
For we have lhevvubesore †,' that this is the na-
tureos an eletlive faculty, and such it ought to
be, otherwise we could not have thc least possi-
t bility os attaining happiness in so great variety

and uncertainty os outward things ἶ.
