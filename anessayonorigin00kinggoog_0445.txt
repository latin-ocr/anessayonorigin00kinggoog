indul ent father who educat'cs his children at school, anddoea
not admit thern to the management os his domestic affaire, or
public business, till room be mnde for thern by the removal of

are born wcalc, ignorant, and unfit lor busmcsa, vviz. to keep

Ξ propogtyon between their present state, and the offices they arc
ergne or.

'Twould be to no purpose fot thern to be born in aeondition ¹

lit sor public, domestic or manly funilions3 when at the same
time there was no room for them to cxcrt themselrea, these being
all taken up by othere. ’Τίς reasonable therefore that they
should wait sor their own turn, which will corne soon enou
when the present possessore are gone off the stage. Nor in the
mean timeare they in a tlate os misery, and aa tt were shut up
ina dungedn‚ but in a condition sufficiently happy and eligible,
and a better than which could not bc given without ejcfling
those which enioy it at present.

Farthei, Is we conceive certain creaturec that by their con·
stitution are naturall subjeft to dissolution, ae 'tie demonstrable
that all things consillin of matter are; and that the raisrng up
new onee in the placeo such as decay, yiclde a greater pleasure

bestowed sooner without dettimcnt to othere. tle might indeed
have not created men, before the besl place they were capable of

wat ready for them. But in the interim he had deprived them ’

os the bencfit which they now enioy, and there would hauc been
no room sor merit or demerit, sor divine iudice or mercy. Ic it
not more reasonable, more worthy of God, to reward them with
the kingdom os heaven for their obediente, and the proos of
their virtues exhibited in au inferioritate, than out of mere good
pleasure to bestow so great a lirvout on them, who had done
nothing at all to deserte it, had given no specimen of their dis·

The first you'll say argues greater munificence. But it
ic the partos prudence to moderate liberalityy and hnce
all could not partnke of it equally (ae in thie case 'tia plain they
could not) to prefer the most deserving.-But it ie urged, wh
did God create more than could be provided sor in the very bel
