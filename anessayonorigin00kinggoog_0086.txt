For in the instance ςῖττττίτ appears that the suti
did always, and from eternity, cause the change
ol seasons: not thatl think the sun really was,
or could be eternal; but if motion lhould be
lu posed eternal (which is the only subterfuge
leli rothem that deny the necessity of an agent,
in order to the existence of motion) the liin
might equally be eternal with its light and their
effedts. And if thisbe granted, .it will plainly
appear, that eternity of atrion does not exclude '
an artior corase. lf then we follow the guidunce -
of our thoughts, we must acknowledge that there
is something beside matter and motion, which
must be the cause of motion.

from it, at least in thought ς but a thing cannot
be separated from its nature or ellence even by
the mind: if therefore existence were efflatial to
matter, it could not be divided from it even in
th ght 3 that is, we could not conceive matter

do that? ls it not as easy to conceive that space
which the material world occupies to be empty,
that is, void of matter, as sall? Cannot the
