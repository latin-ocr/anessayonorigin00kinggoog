Ἴ py: God himself in creating them has deter-

mined, as it were by alaw, that they should be
free. For by giving them a nature endowed
with choice, he allowed them to make· use of
it. They cannot therefore be hindered without
violence done to the laws of the creation. l¹
grant that God can dispenso with the laws os
