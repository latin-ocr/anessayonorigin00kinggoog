Of Moral Evil. 'Chap.v.

cially is they will make a prudent use of their
⁴ elesiions. For if there be any bitter thing in
life, it generally flows from depravcdeledtions,
and by a right use of these, any thing which

creates uneaftness, or can make us weary ¹of
lise, might he mitigatcd or removed· To
conclude, though we complain of the miserita
of life, yet we are unwilling to part with it, Ι
which is a certain indication that it is not a

burden to us, and that not so few attain this
moderate happiness, as the objeetion would
insinuate. (X.) VI

Nous,

(X.) 'Tit objetted that the proof brought here to thern that
there ir more good than evil m the world can't be solid, be·
cause it is founded on one of the greatest and most evident in·
firmities of our nature. For both divinet and philosophere have

. condemned thie fond desire of life aa the greatest imperfefiion

attending mortality, and have judged no evil to be greater enan
the fear of death.

1 confess indeed, that an immoderate defire os life, ae also
dread of death, becomes stnful, when to preserve one or avoid
the other, we are hurried into the violation os the lawr of God,
hut in itself 'tis neither evil noran imperfefiiou3 na , 'tis
good aud part of the duty we owe to God the Giver o Life,
and to ourselves. To be mortal is indeed an imperfedlion, hut
to, sear death and endeavour to avoid it hy all lawful meant is
no uew infirmity of nature, buta necessary means of preferving
the good gift of God so longas he thinks proper to indulge it.
‘Tis also to be observed, that this sear of perishing is founded in
rhc feufe οι· opinion of the ›leasure aud satisfafiion which we
have in life, and these tnusl beata proportior to each other.
increase the opinion of the gooduess of life, and the sear of disso-
lution increafes liltewise: sor· that aman should have a great
sense os the pleasure and satisfaflion he has in a thing, and not
be afraid of losmg it when he apprehenda it in danger, is absurd
and imposlrhle. The sear of death then is not an imperfesiion,
hut rathera preservatire of lise, and a necessary consequence of
that great love and value which we have for it.

But adly, ''I'is urged that it cannot he the sense of the good
we find in lise that makes us defuous of it, and afraid of death,
tince christiane that are persuaded of another lise, aud sumly
believe it to be infinitelv preferable to the present, are 'et
equally detirous of living, and afraid to die, with those that
have no such hope. But they were worse than pagens, if the
reason of that fear was because they thought there was more
. good in this world than in heaven: and therefore it is no good
. argument, to prove that there it more good 'thau evil in the
world,
