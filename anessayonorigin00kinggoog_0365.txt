NOTES.

opinione, that supposes us free only srorn conslralnt, and that
our choiee ie nece arily determined to the good or ill we conceive
in objedlt, the author hae proved that on this supposition happi-
nese is impossible, in his yth chap. sesl’. i. snbvett. 1.par. rt.

At to the ed, which supposes the will ιο be deterrnined hythe · ’

last a& os the ,understandinffi this is shewn to be equivalent to

messity, because the understaviding is necessary and obliged ιο 0 -

‘plidge ae things appear to it. And as to the 3d, that places an
indeffeteuce in the will, the author has slvevvn, Chap. 5. ὅςᾶ. 1.
snbseet. ο. par. 8. that inere indifference os choic'e is of no use,
but rather an impediment ιο happiness, except the will haveat
thesaure timet power ιο melec the thing ehol'en agreeable. ls
such a power be in the will,the anthol· lhews, Subl'ce‘l. ς. of the
same διὰ. par. 22. that the agent poll'elled os it niay be happy
to a certain degree, tho· he bave a very impersecl underllnnding
and commit many rniliakee.

lt ought likewise ιο be considered, that is we really have thir

wer, rt it not material whether we know or believe that we
hiveir or ηας sor whatever ourophiion os it be, it will do itu
own work. lf ιι man believe himself free, nr generally men do,
when he really ie neeellitatecl by aforce he doth not peredit,
he ie never the freer on thar account. And if he believe himself
nerelhtated contrary to wllat he seels in hir own mind, as some
tre persuaded to do by the sopliiliical argninehrvos vain philoso-
pherr, lie ie never the less l'ree sor· that. And hence it is, that
whatever opinion rnen have concerning the l'reedom or necessity
os choiee, they are equally pleal'ccl or rlil'pleased with it, when
once it it made3 because the pleasnre deth not arise‘srotn their

no such liberty as this ς that the good arigels are perscellp dc·
termined to love Gnd, and the souls os rnen as soon av they en·
ter heaven, cease to be indifferent ιο good and evil, and cannot
malie any other rhen a good choico.

tf thie ie intended against the anther't position, the inserente
miili be, either that the angele und sainte do not aslnally choose
ἰο be in heaven, or that heaven dorh not please berarde they
‚ehoose to be there, neither os which eonl'equeneee do at ull fol-
low. But then ir it hot drenge, that a liberty os indifference
which senaim no longer than our miseralile sojournin on earth,
aod ie at tn end ae soon aa a inan begine ιο be persedly happy,
droulvl beneeessary to onrhappinesr, and the sountain os it heret
'l'o which 1 eritwer, thet the whole argument iv founded on a
grettmillnhe.

The author believes that the engela and blelled in heaven are
happy only hy this means 3 that they sveely choeseevery· ael that
they perform, aud are asireyo able to etecute what they theose.
