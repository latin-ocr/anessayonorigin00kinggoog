Concerning the Criterion os Virtue·

r

HE Criterion os any thing is arule or measure. by
’ nconsormity with which any thing is known to
bens this or that sort, oros this or that degree. And
in order to determine thecriterion os any thing, we' niust
first know the thing whose criterion we are secking alter. ¹
For a measure presupposes the idea os the thing to be
nteasured, otherwise rt could not be known, whether it
was fit to measure it or ηρ, (since what is the proper
measure os one thing is not so os another) Liquids, -
eloth, nnd flesh, hane all different measutes; gold and lil-
vetdifferent touchstones. This is very intelligible, and
the tnethod os doing it generally clear, when either the Ι
quantity³ ot kind os any particular substance is thus as-
certarne.

liut when we extend our enqniriet after a Critetion
sut abstrait, mixed. modes, which have no existence but
in our minds‚ and are so very dili'erent in different
men t we kre apt to be consuunded, and search aster a
measure sor we know not what. For unless we are first
agreed concerning the thing· to be measured, we shall
in {⁸³¹2} erige& to agtge in outcriterion os it,or even to
un er an oneanot er. s

But it may be said, isne are exadly agreed in any
mixed mede, what need os any criterirn? or what cun
we wantsume? ll het weuant sartlter, a'nd what we
