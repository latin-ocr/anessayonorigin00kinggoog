he same might happen in the world, in an infinite
seriee ofmutations, if au one aetion were changed: it mull he
of great consequence to the whole, if God should interpose and
alter any the minutest thing; aud perhaps change the whole
original sciveme. lf therefore that sc eme wae at first eonuired

alter any thing in it would certainly make it worsee if it had
not been besl sor the whole that man should be pennitted tostii,
God would not have done it; and isit was besl, he ought not
to alter it. Free ereaturee were wanted tothe cetionosthe
world, that ie, such creaturce ae being essentia ly short of per-

belief of our being free that givet ue the pleafure, but the true

firmly that he sees ot· knows a thing. yet it hie faculty of right
or knowledge were not really exercilus, he would neither have
