jesi, is he proposes to ast upon any serious and settled

views here, or to entertain any well grouuded hopes os
' suturity. When 1 begin to enquire how l came into
this world at first, and was doomed to my present sta-
tion, 1 am told that an absolutely perse&- Being pro·

concern sor his Maker's honour, or his own ultimate

happiness3-that dehres to make some returns os‘a
suitable homage to the Suprema [ord os all, and an-
swer the true end os his own creations-in short, that
happens to think at all upon these matters, and to
think for himself agan attempt therefore to rid the

mind
