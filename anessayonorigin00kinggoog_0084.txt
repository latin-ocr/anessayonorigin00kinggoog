minda, it will appear that the nature os matter
(aa sar as we lcnowx os it) is indifferent to iiio,
tion, or rest, and moves not except it be mov-
ed. Motion therefore does not follow stom iti
nature, nor is it contained in ite esscnce‚ nor do
we conceive it to arise from thence: matter is
therefore merely passive in tegardbtomotions
and an agent must be sought elsewhere. ‘ls you
say it has been in motion stom eternity, you
will be never the nearer ς sorduration alters not '

the denying that, would iinply the negationes, or be inconst ent
with some other known truth; then the necessity os that triith nrisea
stom the relation which it lias to some consequemini trutli. Ne·
cessity is also applied to axioms3 and then it hat relation to the
terina themselves, i. e. it arisee from the relation which is between
the reims, and meane that siipposing oi laying down those terina,
that relation or connection between them cannot but be. Far·
ther, the same may be said os truth, as uf meanti trutli being
relative also; consequently such phrases ae these, true or false iit

Necessity ia also applied to existence, and then it ariset either
sium the relation which the exillcnce os that thin os which it it
affirmed has to the existence of other thiagni or stom the relation
which the existence ol' that thing hae to the manner of r'ts own
cxillence, In the soriner signification, when necessity os exist·
erice has relation to the eitillcnce os other things, it ‹lenotes that
the siipposition os the non-existence os that thing os which neces·
hty ia affirmed, implica the non-existence os things which we
ltnow to exill. Thua some independent being does necejffiiri‘sy
txss3 because to suppose no inilepcndent being implies that there
aretio dependent heingi, the contrary os which we know to be
ti·ue; so that necessity os existence in thia sense, ia nothing elte
but necessity os tiiith aa related to conseqiiential trueh. And thia
sort os proos ia called demonstratio a posteriori.

When the necessity os exiliente arit'ea from the relation which
the existence os any thing hia to the manner os ita own exiliente,
then necessity meana thot that thing os which it ia affirmed cirilla
aster such a manner that it iieiier could have not existed. Thue
