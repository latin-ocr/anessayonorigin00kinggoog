which is in it, if it was froin eternity‚ it was
still paffloe ὀπί), and there wanted an eternal
agent to produce eternal niotiori (5) in it: for
eternal action cannot be more easily conceived,
' withoutan eternal agent, than temporary, with·
out a tempora] one. ssut you will say, what is
eternal, since it was never made, requires no
cause. Why fo? Suppose the fun to have lhin·

its hear„ to have undergone eternal viciffitudee
of seafons3 had those vicissitudo therefore no

ty

cause? W ould they be ever the less dependent '

oti the sun as their source and original? Hence
itappears that eternity of action does not exclude
an aflive cause, and it is so far froin truth that
such altiori was never produced, because itia
conceived to have been from eternity‚ that we

must rather say ir baa always been produced.
