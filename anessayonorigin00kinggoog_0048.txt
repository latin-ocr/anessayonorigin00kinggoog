most men that are used to relledlion, may remember tho

very time when they were first under the domifflon ol it.
= Erivy is· generally defined to be that painwhicla ariles in
the mind from ohserving tle prosperity ofothers: not ol·
alt others indefinitely‚ but only ol some particularpersona·
Now the examining who thple articulat persons whom
we are apt'to cnvy are, will lead us to the true originol
this passion. hnd if a man will he at the pains to con·.
sult his mind, or to loolt into the world, he'll lind that
these particular persons are always such as upon some ac·
count or other he has had arivayhip with. For when two
ll {llhss‘hlllssl‘lzssll‘dh{tlh‘llhmli siliis}
other, or others ε hence the success ol my rival and mile·
ry or pain are join’d together in my mind t and thisxcona=

“ nenton or affociation remaining rn my mind, even after-

the rivallbip males, makes me always affeded with pain
wheneverl hear ol his success, though in affairs which
have no, manner of relation to the rivallhip; much more
in thofe that bring that to my remembrance, and put me

i‘n ιτέἱρά ol what l might have enjoyed had it not been¹
or tm. ·

Thus also we are apt to envy those persons that refuse
to be guided by our judgments, and persuaded by us. For.
this is nothing elle‘thana rivallhip about the superiority
ofj'ndgrnentr and we takeasecret pride, both to let¹
tlpe'lh'iprld sce,and in imagining ourselyes² that we are in¹
terr t. .

Thegre is one thing more ro beohserved in answer to this„
‚bjedliem and that is, that we do not always rand perhaps,
not lor the most parti male this allociation ourlelves, but
learrr it lrom others: ἰ. e. that we annex plealun· or pain to,
certain things or actions becaule we see others do it, and
'acquire principles of adron by imitating those whom we
admire, or whole esteem we would procure: Hence the
lontoo often inhesits both the vices and the party of his
father, as well aa his estate: thce rational virtues and
vices, dil'pcsttions and opinions: And lrom 'hence we may
