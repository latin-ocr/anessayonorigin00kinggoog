so ‚shong3 yet having made no observations, and being .
absolutely without· experiente, he could know no more of
any thing, than what was rewealed by God to him. And
there was no neceffity that God should reveal more
knowledge to him than was at present to be used by him.
Yon may observe in the 19th verse os this chapter, that
‚aut of the ground the Lord God formed every beust of the
field, and every sotol of the air, aad brought them to Adam,
to see what he would call them, and tobatsoever Adam
vallati every living creature, that was the name thereos.
This was the way by which God taught him language;
and you see it went no farther than the names of the beasts .
os the earth, and sowls os the air amongst whom he
lived, and over whom he was to exercisedominion.

Nor wasit any impersettion in the sirst‘man5 that he
was ignorant os the nature of things, if we suppose that
he had a certain way to come to that knowledge,¹ when he
had occasion fot it. For the defigo osknowledge is not to
amose us or fill out heads with notions‚ but to serve and
dire& us in the affairs os lise. It is only this sort os·
knowledge that is truly valuable: and he that has most
os it and best applies it, is to be accounted most wise.¹ If
therefore Mam hada certain way os knowin the nature
os every thing, when he was to employ that hnowledgee
though he was attually without it, yet he was in a better
state than any os his sterhy, who have made many ob-
servations, and are urnished with many athual notione,
buthave no certain way os cominpto such knowledge as
upon eve occafion isnecessary or their ditestion

3dly. T ereforewe most conceivethatAdam was ander
the immediate condo& and direttion ofGod, and was not
to jud sothimsels,.but was to leave himself entirely to be
guide and diredted by his Maker. Yon see he was not·
left to determine sor himself what he should eat: ButGod
by revelation assigned him his sood, and provided it fot
him. So chap. i. ver. 29. And Godsat'd, Behold slave·
