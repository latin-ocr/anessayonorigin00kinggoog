OfMoral Evil. Chap. V.

η VII. From the same principles we may solve
lhat sormidable objedion of Epicurus against

providence, which Lassantius enfotces in his

ook Dr Ira Deia- and, as some think, does

not sufficiently answer. It stands thus: “ Either

· “ God is willing to remove evila, and not able,

‘⁵ or able and not willing, or neither able nor
“ willing. lf he be willing and not able, he
“ is imputent, which cannot be applied to the
·“ Deity: lf he be able and not willing, heis
“ envious5 which is equally inconsistent with

, “ the nature of God. lfhe be neither willing

“ nor able, he is both envious and impotem,
“ and consequently no God. lf he be both
“· willing and able, which is the only thing that
“ answers tothe notion of aGod, from whence
“ cpme evils? Or why does he not remove
“ t em?⁸'

VIII. We must take the third os those four
branches of his knotty argument3 viz. That

God neither will nor can remove evils. (84.)

(84.) Leibnitz would rather say, “ that God could talte them
'⁸ away, hut he wat not willing to do it absolutely3 and fora
,tt very good reason, because he should have taken away the
‘⁸ good at the same time, aud because he should have {alten
“ away more good than evil [o.].''
