“xx PREFACE:

with any other, much more necessary studies,· as will
appear below. And here one cannot avoid stupping to
lament, the notorious' weakness of the human mind· a ’
= which instead ofexerting its own native powers of exa-
mining and judging in points of Faith, is ever apt to
lhelter itself under some sorry system of opinions, acci-
dentally thrown in its way, and thro’ mete indolence, or Ι
perhaps dread of that odiam theologicum, which too often
attends on each attempt toward any improvement, or
¹, what is called innovation,⁴(tho’ it be no more in reality
thanremovingthoseinnovationsmadebytime,thegreat·
est of all innovatam, according to Lord Boron), sits down
contented with its ancient state of ignorance, and blind
credulity, willing to connive at all those gross and glar-
ing absurdities that have long beset it; and been suffered
tocontinue inl'omanyleatncdandreligioussocieties. But

- itis hoped that moll of these ate already seen thro‘, and
will lhortly be discatded by the laudable endeavours of
the Univetstty of Cambridge in'particulat, which is la· ⁸
bouring to reform such abuses, and restore its creditto
that first degree in Arts, and the Exercise preparato-

tyto it, which was once the peculiar glory of this place:

andwhereuponnot only the academical character of each
candidate, but likewisehis success in life does still very

much depend; well auare that this long destred piece of
reformation, can never be secured effedlually but bya
caresul and impartial distribution of those honours

which usually attend the said promotion, a prospect
whercof is found to bc the great objedlof ambition, to

many of these young men from the very time of their
admiffion into college, to this they often sacrifice ’

their whole stoclc of strength and spirits, and lo entirely
devote most of their first four years to what is called

arliag a gaal degree, ar to be hardly good for any thiyyg
