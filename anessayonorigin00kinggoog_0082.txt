to be, or to be capable of annihilation‚ 'tis plain
that nectffary existence belongs not to them, nor
are they os'thentsel·res; they must therefore have
their being stom· something else. For, srnce'

¹in things to be otherwise necessary than as they

are in their own nature indifferent, that is, paffive
in regard to existence. 'F0r‚ is our con·
