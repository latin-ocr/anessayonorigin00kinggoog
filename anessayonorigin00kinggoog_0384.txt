ssrewn that, hythe same necessity natural evile
are annexed to things naturally impersesi‚ aud
that God, agreeably to what infinite power and
goodness required, permitted no manner os evil
in nature, the absence whereos would not have
introduced more or greater evil. Since there·
sore inconveniencies attend either the presence
- or absence os it, God made that which was at-
tended with the least. There are no evils then
which could possibly be avoided, and therefore
they must be looked upon as necessary, since the
impersestion os a creature did not admit os pure
and absolute good. Birt thie necessity does not
appear in free agents: sor the evils incident to
them seem to praeced, not srorn impersestion os
nature, but free choice, andare therefore permit·
ted by God voluntarily, finee neither the nature
os things, nor the good os 'the universe require
the permissron of them: thetis, the world would

be as well without as with them.
Mor-²¹ θ· ll. lt is to be observed, that God permitted
ζ’ὲζιῗζῖῑζ the former kind os evils because they were inse·
ryconnec- parable from things; either therefore the thingr
2¹22?ssss must not have been created, or their inherent
rure, nor evils tolerated. But evil eleslions haue no ne·
'¹5‘ of ³wcessary conneslion with the free asts os the will:
{glssmg‘ neither does the nature os man require that he
should choose amisse nor does any benefit ac·
erue to him from these elestions which could
not be obtained without them, as it does in hun·
ger, thirst, sear, and the rest os the passinus:
for without ‘these assession's, as was shewn, the
animal would foon perish ; but no evil would
befal us (nay what good would not i) is we al·
ways attended to reason, and never chose amiss.
Since therefore man might bring the greatest
pleafure to himself, and exereise his faculties by
choosmg always well, how comes it to pass that
God suffers him to hurt himself und others un·
’ necessarily·
