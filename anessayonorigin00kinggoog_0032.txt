i mean by theeriterion o'f it, is this3 niz. to know whe-

ther any particular thing 'do belong to this mixed mode
’01 10. And this isa very proper enquiry. For letaman
.· learn the idea of Intemperance from you never 10 clear·
ry, and 11 you please¹ let this be the idea, viz. the eating
ot drinking to that degree as 10 injure his understand·
ingor health3' and let him also he never so‘much con-
.vineed 01 theobligation to avoid it3 yet 11 11 avery
· pertinent question in him to alk you, How lhall l know
whenl am guilty 01 Intemperance 1 ,
And 11 we examine this· thoronghly‚ we rhall find
that every little differenee in the definition of a mixed 1
mode will requirea different criterium· e. . If murder
is defined the wilful takin awaythe lifeo another, it 11
evident, that to enquire aiter the Criterion 01 11111111,Ι
2 is toenquite how we lhall know when the life of another
. is taken away wilsully; i. e. when one who takes away
the life 01 another does it with that malicious defigo,
which it implied by wilfrdneys. But 11 murder be defined
the guilty taking away the life of another, then to en·
· gpire after the criterion 01 murder, is to enquire how iti

Ι all be known when gailt 11 contraded in 'the wilful .

. taking away the lile of another. So that the criterion 01
murder, according to one or other 01 these definitione,
· will be different. For wilfulness perhaps will be made
the criterion 01 guilt; bnt willhlness itfelf, if it want
any, must have some farther criterion ς 11 being trident
diat nothing can be the measure of itself. ¹

If the criterion is contained in the idea itfelf, then it 11
merely arominal, eg. 11 virtue 11 defined, the ading a·
{illidii} llll {lltylosilyfhllll‘gllll
to the will of God is called Virtue. But the real crite·
· tion, which 1101 some use, 1111111, How sstalllknov
whatthe Will of Godis in this respedl? ’ ’
” From hence 1111 11111111,11111111111111010111111111
mode is neither the definition 01 11,101 contained 1111.
For, ar has been ssrewn, the general· idea isneceliarily to
