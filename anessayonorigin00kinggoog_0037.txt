sioned all· this consufionr as may easily be made appear
io all the pretended criterionsosvirtueabove mentioned.

-Thus those who either expressly exclude, or don’t
mention the will os Gon, making the immediate cri-
terion os virtue to be the good of mankind ; must either
allow that virtue is not in all cases obligatory (contrary
rothe idea which all or mbst men have of it) or they
must say that the good of mankind is a sufficient obli·
gation. But how canthe good os mankind b'e any obli-
gation to mc, when perhaps in particular cases, such as
paying down my life, or the like, it is contrary tp my

a iness? <

ilihose who drop the happiness os mankind, and talk Ι
os the relations, the fitness and unfitness of things, are
still more remote srorn the true criterion. For fitnesr,
without relation to some end, is scarce intelligible.

Reason and truth come pretty near the relations of
things, because they manifestly ptesuppose them; but
ape still one step sarther stom the imiitediate criterion ,
o vrrtue.

What hasbeen said concerning the criterion os vir·
tue as including our constant obligation to it, may per-
haps be allowed to be ttue5 but still it will be urged,
-that it is insufficient to account sor matter os faet, viz.
that most persons, who are either ignorant of, 'or never .
considered these dedudlions, do however pursue virtue'
themselves, and approve os itin others. l [hall in
the next place therefore give some account os our ap·
probatioris and affection.
