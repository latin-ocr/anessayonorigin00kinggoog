and these must of necellity· be equally infinite
with his power, otherwise infinite evils must
certainly arise from infinite power. But a crea-
ture, as his eledive power necessarily extends
fartber than bis wildorn and goodnefs‚ is made
naturally liable to fall sometimes into evils. ’uis
well known that mathematicians sometimes sup· -
pose a line to be infinite, in which they mayolo
a p'oint wherever they please. Now since our
eledion may be made as we please„tbe wisdonr
and goodness whereby it isto be governed‚
ought to be infinite3 for if the line be sinite,a
point may be pitched upon beyond it: and in
like manner, if the goodness andwisdombe finite,
the choice may be rnade without and beyond
thern, that is, antiss. But slnce all created wif-
dorn and goodness must necessarily be finite, it
follows that there wants a sufficient restraint upon
elefhom, and that every fr‘ee creature ia neces·
sarily deseslible. As then all created beings are
necessarily imperfebt in general, so every one has
its own peculiar defert. And this kind of im·
perfefiion viz. the power os sinning, is proper
and peculiar to such as enjoy free-will: nor can
they be conceived separate from each other, any
more than contrariety from motion. (6 5.)
