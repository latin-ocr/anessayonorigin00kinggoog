aldam more unreasouablc in the state of innocence than hia
'posterity are in the flate of corruption. For, according to thir,
rt aroald have grieved him to think that hia chooliug right var
duc to God'r assistance, aud that he would nothone believed
himself happy, if when he was ready to break God'r command,
he had perceived that God by hir grace had interpoledaud
enabled him to relist the temptation. Whereaa in truth, such
a discrirery would hare made him, aa it musi make ua, mora
happy, t'yrng him by a new obligation to acknovrledge the
sorereign goodnel‘r of God, audon that ιιιοιιιιι ιο lore aad
adhcre to him the more closely. But it iaalledged, thattbc
author ir absolutely of arrother opinion.

1Ῑ answer‚ the objector may affore himself. the author hat
no such opinion, nor ie there any thing like it in the book, or
that can be deduced from it. What the author faya ia, that
God has made man an intelligent emanire, capable of pleafing
himself by cholen that the proper way ιο more hia will is by
rewards and punishmentr, aa the proper wa'y to more bodier ιι
by physical impulfc3 that iri the ordinary course of things it ie
aa improper, and perhaps aa impraeiieable‚ ιο move tlae will by
any other force th'an that of rational metirer. aa ιο attempt to
move a body by rewardr and punillrments: that there ir thia
differente between them, that abody necessarily mores when
impelled, but the will is not neeellitated by thc moral motirca

roposed to it. That there are two sorta of goodr which may
he proposed to a man, one that arises from the convenience of
things ιο our natural appetitcs‚ and is antecedent to choice,
and another that ie founded in the choiee itsels, and consequent
to it; and that the first is lirbordinate to the second.

When therefore these two interfere, the former gives placeto
the latter: and hence we l'ee many men prefer their choico eren
to life, which is the greatest natural good, tho* 'tis true, thir
is done with ‹lidicuhy aud reluc‘iance. But when there is no
such interfering between the choiee and ap thes, there the
man is entirely free, and c'an make the thing c osen good with·
out mixture3 which happens Ξιι a thousand inflantes of life,
and therefore there is much more good than evil in it.

Aa ιο Adam, he evas placed iu this flate of fieedom hecauh¹
his nature required it5 and the author believes God might hare
preventcd his choosmg omiss, if he would hare altered hia nature,
motirea and cir·cumstances; that is, made a new world for
him, and left this without intelligent inhabitante. ldo not
deny but God may llop man from executing hir choice, when
he is ready to make an ill one; for no body ought to prelhmeto
limit the Dirine Power. Butl say, whena free agent is ready
ιο make an ill ehoice, and would do it if not prevented by an
AlmightyPower, heia already guilty in the sight of Godr
fuich a readiness is an obliquity in hia will anda moral eril;
