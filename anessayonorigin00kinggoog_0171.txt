powerful‚ could not separate things from the
concomitant evilsof imperfection, and did not
esteem it unbecoming himself to create the
good, though that brought some evils along
with it, so long as these evils are less than
the good with which they are connected. Nor
can the creature justly complain of its condi·
tion, if it have not all, or equal perfefflon
with some others· fince ’twas unneceffarv that ,
it should fill the hation wherein it' was placed,
