Cnncerning the Naluteos Chnp. 11,
if there war so much good in thesel‘asmade
him think ¹i better to creare them,· though
they were toste corrupted some time or other
by the oppofite principle, he might also judgo
it preferable to produce the farne,¹ though
they were at len thro perisstby their own
inherent evils. or will God be forced to

' tolerate evil in his works more according to

the manicheans, than the catholice, Foras he
tltlzltl lllssfflltllf‘ llttt llll
might alsohave notyrnade thole which lie fore?
knew the contrary principles would corrupt.
After the fame manner in both cases he would

have prevented evii, and fince he could, why
did henot? The suppofition of two prinicples¹
conducet nothing at all therefore to the soluti·

on of this difficulty. (B.)

Now& tx. But

' (imo thie it her been obiected, rtet, thet the recrininetion

prevented the sall of Alam. and therefore the hieme of it lier
'on him ς whereas according rothe system of two principle·
ne could nor hinder it, and therefore ie exculed thre wey, but nor
the other.

But lantwen it ie plain that the objeeiion doce not under.

could ltere preventetl thieevil. He foresto the ill principle
would corrupi mankind3 end he wne under no neteliity ro enak!

he saw, would make hini misereble. He could therefore here
