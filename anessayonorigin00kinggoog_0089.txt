lf therefore we consult our ideas, we must
confess that matter does not exist necessarily,

as to motion or rest 3 i. e. isin that refpedt mere· -
ly palhve. It requires a cause then which may
determine it to exissence no less than to motion.
For that which is not of itfelf must necessarily
be of another, nor can we know that any thing

we have of its nature 3 if t'hefe represent the na-
ture of any thing as necefflrrr'ly existing, so that
we cannot conceive it not to be, we enquire no
farther about its cause3 if not, we sly to a causer
noris the understanding satisfied till it has found
one. Why are we inquifitive about the original
os man, or any thing else? but only because
our conceptione represent these as indifferent in
themselves to being, and therefore as requiring
some cause of their existence distinet from them-
selves. From the nature then of matter as well
as motion, we are forced to admit of another prin-
ciple to be the cause of both.

vn. lhirdly. As to space, many doubt whe- 'rh t

Whether it can be annihilated even in thought, ‚first figit
or conceived not to have been. For when the fflflssffn'
whole material world is annihilated in the mind, extranee
the idea of spate remains‚ as of a thing yet ex·

Vlll. This seems to argue strongly for the nr.
sels-eustence of space. Yet a doubt may arife susm*
