On tchill of Man. 441· -

· alid that in order to confer that grace there ought tobe
some obvious means, easy to' be known and ready to be

used. And perhaps it will be hard to think of any
othervaysnsnitableasthiswhichuod chose. Forif some
outvvardmeansou ht to be used, thisrestraining him from
the use osone of tite trees seems the most propert some
such symbol seems not only reasonable but neceffary3 and
food being the only thing he needed, and that provided
for him out of the fruits of the earth, the instance could
not be so proper in any other matter.

3d¹Y= We must remember that man was created a free
agent, and it is the nature of such to be pleased with no· '
thing that is not agreeable to their choiee. The best and α
most pleastn thing in the world if it be ·forced on us
against our clinice, is untasy to us. There must be some-
thing of choice in what makes us happy; and could there
be a more easy thing to bc left to that, than not to 'eat of
‘one tree where there vere so many? We may imagine
that God in effe& said to man, Your nature requires that
you lhould choose those things the enjoymentvthere'of will
make you happy. l will make your duty easy unto you;
abstain from thisone tree, and whilst you do so,Iwill take
care thatyoulhall not chooseamiss in any thing else! Your
obedience in this lhall be an infallible means to secure you
from choosm wrong in any other thing. Whilst you ul'e
your free-wiliright in this, l will take care that you lhall
not abuse‘iton any other occasion. Some instance of your
free obediente is necelsary: And this is the mosteasy that
could be provided for you. But byyourwtonguseoffrte·

Surely this account m es this command very reason-
able, very agreeable sor God to give, and inan to receive.
Andfromthisit appears, that itwasnot givenmerelyasart
arbitrary trialos subiniffion to the will of God, but rather
as a means to facilitate and secure the obediente we owe
him. When Christ sent the blind man to the svaters of Si-
