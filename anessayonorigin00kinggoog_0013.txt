‚mind ol these perplexities, cannot surely. be unaccep-
table-But both the usefulness and antiquity of that
celebrated controversy, concerning evil, as well as the
notorious absurdity of the Manichean method of ac·
counting for it, have heen so frequently and, fully set
forth, that there is no need of enlarging upon them,

since all that ever seemed necellary to a complete con·

Hypothehs, was only some tolerable solution of the
difficulties which drove them into it 3 and this our

other begins witha view of the phaenomena themselves,
traces thern up to th'eir original, and by developing
the properties of these phaenomena, arrives at the know·
