the sowcr sor throwing away his corn, For there
is no doubt but the present state os things is as
necessary, not only to the earth lest it should be

(W.) But it ia asseed, sance man ia capable os a better state,
why did not God lace him in it immediately? Can it he agree·
v ableto an infinite y good being to delay so great a benefit, and
“make hia creaturos wait sor it witha long train os sufferings,
when he might have placed them in that happy condition at
