all are happy according to their several capacities3 and
so it is in hell, where all are miserableif comparedwith the
condition of the bleffed, but in different degrees; and at
in this life some are so unfortunateathat it were better for
them not to be at all, than to continue always in the state

to his natural saculties to guide anddireft him; let him be
as it were hisown God, and enjoy thc fruit of his choice.
*To this purpose he deprivedhitn of the use of the trec of
life, drove him out of the gardenwhereitwac, and fenccd
it against hitn. · xx
