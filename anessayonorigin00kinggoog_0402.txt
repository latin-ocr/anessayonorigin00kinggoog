him, are no lest happy in themselves, nor perform a lest ae·
ceptable service to tlte Deity, for the want of it; and why
therefore might not wel-To what was observed about the
ittclustveness os all litelr arguments astte drawn from beingt ol
a different order iu note (E) we shall here add, first, That it
is more than we are obliged to grant, thart either attgelsor saints
in heaven are absolutely devoid os liberty. They may have'
'nrore clear impressione of 'good and evil ott their mindo, more
enlarged understandings, fewer' aud lest temptatione, &et

more sree, the more they are so qualibed [e]. This vray ol

Sectititlly, Though it should bc granted that thesegloriout
beings, suppostng tltettt all necessary, might have aa ample
knowledge, as ardent love of the divine persedtions‚ and con·
liquently be as hap y in the enjoymentol'God and themselves,
as is they were all sice ς though they might have no occasion to

wisdotn, power and goodness of the Deity, shewtt itt thego·
vcrnment and suppression of the former, and itt the produtlion
and improvement of tlte latter: though, 1 say, these exaltet!
beings could be supposed to have a tltorough intuition of etl the
attributes os God without any such manifestatiou of them in
his works; (against which notion see D'Oyly’s first Dt'ff. C. sa
and conflaſsem p. ιη.) yet it does not seem pollible forsueh
impersedi creatures as we are, to attain unto this excellent
knowledge, and enjoy tlte happy effetis of it en an'y other tants
thart the present. We could not sure have had so lively sn ider
of the mercy of God, is there had never been any proper objetlt
of it. We could not have been so thoroughly conscroua os out
