he will refer ir to the determinet. Nor will'he
be angry with himself, unless he be conscious
that it was in his power not to have done them:
but he cannot bc conscious of this (except
through ignorance and error) who is determintd
by another. For no others ought to be look'ed
upon as true causes, but such as are free. Those
that operate necessarily, are to be conceived as
paffioe, and we must rtcur to some otherwhich

one that is free, where we must stop. Since
then the agent endowed with this power, is de·
termined by himself and no other, aud is free
in his operatione, we must acquiesce in him as
areal cause, and he ought to be esteemed the
authoros whatever he does, well or ill. (L.) ·
