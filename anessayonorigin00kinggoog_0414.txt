Such suppositione as these would breed endless consufion. For
we rnust either know whether another did this astion or notr is
we do know this, then how tan we attribute that to oursrlves,
or pride ourselvea in that, which we know belongs to another?
Η we do not know this, then how can we attribute to oursehres,
or please ourselveain any thing? Since every thing inand about
us may, fot what we know, be done by another3 and soweitt
