§est 5, Sub. 2. Of Morus Enil⁸¹

¹:night induce ns to hear them in prospe& os a
sarther end. But to cndure a thing in view os· Ι
asarthet end, is to undergo present misery in

hopes os future happiness, ι. e. to weigh a pte·
sent evil againsta future good, and os two evils
to choose theless 3 which reason indeed persuades
us to do, since it is necessary that it should be
done: but this hclps nothing towards a vindica·
tion os the divine goodness, which has imposed
this necessity upon us : nor can hc be happy by
the judgtncnt os his own understanding, who
must undergo these things. But is it be granted
that things please us, not because the under-
standing jndges thern to be eligihle, but because
we resolve to exercisc our free-will in perform-

,ing thena, even these will become agrccable by
eleslion, and the understanding will perceive
them to be made s0, and not make thern to be
soss *Tis not therefore the office os the under-
standing to govctn the will, but to discover
means sot the attaintnent os that which is chosen,
and to give warning when'it chooses such things
as are absurdnor impossible: sot the understand-

absurdities, we make use os the understanding as
a monitor,nota master.

, And srorn hence, l think it appears, how in·
convenient it would besor the choice to depend
in all cases u‘pon the understanding. For since
the judgment os thettnderstanding depende upon
the objec‘ts themselves, and the natural congruity
which they bear to the appetites3 is the choice
were to be deternrined by its judgtnent, it is
evident that we must necessarily want a great
many things which the understanding judges to
be good, and could never hope sot solid happi-
