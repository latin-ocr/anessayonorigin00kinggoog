that the chimera thoe cloathed with them musi needs bosonethr'ng.
Setting aside the names of its other· pretendcd propentico (which
namet allo are av merely negative ae the supposed propertiee to
which they belong) those that attribute extenfion to space seem
not to attend ιο the true notion of that property, which, aa the
