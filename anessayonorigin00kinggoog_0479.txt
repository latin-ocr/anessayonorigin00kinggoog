’tis fit the particular ones should give wayto placeto

the more universal, ancl those os less moment ἔξω ines,

to the rnorc important. For instance, 'tis os oncant

the nature os body that it be capable os motion, kind of

that it be stoppcd and broken in picces by meet· Zpffl'

ing with others in motion, and this is the uni· noete ’
versal law os bodies. But it is of the nature ΝΜ·
of an animal to preserve itsclf, and use its utmost
endeavour, that the parts os its body be not se-
parated or dissolved, and thinis the particular

lato of animals.

Now fince these laws are sometimes incon-
srstent, it is reasonable that the latter, as being
aparticular one and os less consequence, should
yield to the former: and this is evidently the
will os God. Is it be asked, Why did God
make laws which in sorne respect intersere with
one another? 1 answer‚ as before, That this
could not be avoided without e greater evil: ⁸
since therefore of two evils the less is to be
cholen, God will'd that particular laws¹ and
those of less consequence, should give place to '
the ruore universal and those os greater impor-
tante, rather than remove that inconsrllency,
there ariling less ,inconvenience to nature stom
thence. '

lll. The sante must be said os those lawe 'fierine
which relate to morality. ’Tis the universal {25¹2stss
law os free agents, that they shall please thern· rheteum
selves by eledion, but there are some things ffifilffie
eligible which may be prejudicio! to sonte par· moral
ticular beings. Now 1t is better, as was said *wld-
before, that particulare be injured‚ than that
the universal law of free agents be violated.

We must suppose then that God willed this as
the less evil of the two. Men are pennitted
theresore to abuse their free will, and ’tis ne-
cessary th'at God should tolerate either this in·
convenience ot a greater. But it is not at all
