Concerning undue Eleblietr.

1., ROM hence it is 'sufficiently evidens, notan
what kind os eleslions are to be.'ealled “¹⁰3¹ οἵ
undarlones: For it appears, that God has given ζᾊιζξζζζ
us this faculty of choosnig,⁸ that we may plea'se mitius,
'ourselves in the use of it, and be happy in the ssifgm
fruition of thofe ohjedls which we choofe. For tneruhre'
¹it isa happiness to obtain the things cholen, when Μ
,and misery to be frustrated and fall short osmi„
them. Whensoever therefore we knowingly notbesn·
make fuch achoice, as not to be able to εῑῃογέἣζξξζς
'the thin schofen, it is plain that we choose suol- done nr, ·
ilhlyaniunduely: forwe bringu on ourselve’s when s¹¹⁶¹¹
unnecellary misery, since we could have chosen ζὶᾞξξῖῗ
otherwise with equal pleasuye. Whoever then are impur-
choofes knowingly what he cannot obtain, orffl‘· .
what may produce unneceffary trouble to him-
self or others, hc must be esteemetl to chool‘e un-'
duely. And this may be done, first, If any one
choofe impoffibilt'ties. lt may seem strange thut
any person should chool'e a thing which is im-
possible, knowing it to bes0; but ’tis very pro· .
bable that this has happened sometimes, as was
saitl before *.

ΙΙ. Secontlly, lfhe choose such things as are scmmtty,
inconststent with each other: hc that does this Wlffl
contradit'ts himself, and evidently cuts off all {¹3ss are
hopes of enjoyrnent. When we will any thing, closis
we must take allits necessary consequentes toge- {mm
ther with it. But all things here are of a mixed urstisius
kind, and nothin is pure frorn all degrees oforheu
bitterness: we 0 ten therefore will that part ina
certain thing whichis agreeable to tlte appetites,
ancl tefufe the rest: but this is in vain, sincethe
